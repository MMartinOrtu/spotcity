## How to store the hight score
One posible way to store the high score would be using LocalStorage. We could also use a database to persist data like high score.

## Ideas to improve the game
Here are some ideas to improve the game:
+ Add a timer, so the user have limited time to find the cities location. 
+ Instead of showing the right location, give three tries to spot the city correctly, showing not only the distance to city but also the direction (70 km NW).
+ Create a ranking of users, based on who has spotted the nine cities, ordered by time.
+ Adding more cities and different levels. For example: Level 1: Cities of Europe; Level 2: Cities of America, Level 3: Cities of Africa, etc.
+ Add some music.
